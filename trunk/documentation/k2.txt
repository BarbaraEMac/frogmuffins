	Name Server
	==========
	The name server is an array of {char name[], int tid} structs. There is
	nothing fancy about the array. To register a new name and tid, we traverse
	the array looking for an identical string. If one is found, the tid is 
	updated. Otherwise, the new entry is appended to the end of the array.

	To look up an item by name, the array is linearly traversed until a
	matching string is found OR the end of the elements has been reached.
	If a name is not in the array, the WhoIs() call does not block. Instead,
	it returns a NOT_FOUND error code and we let the calling user task handle
	the error.
