TODO FOR PROJECT

	* Design a UI
		- Position of train
		- State of each switch
		- List of recently triggered sensors & updated times
		- Splash Screen
		- shell prompt
	
	* Calibrate the speeds
		- Run tests to determine the speeds for each train
	
	* Error / Fault Detection
		- Faulty sensor (mis-trigger)
		- Faulty switch (switch during running)
		- Train getting stuck on switch during reverse
		- UART1 becomes unplugged - no commands go through
		- Faulty state after running for a long time
		- 
		- How else can the train fail?

	* Track Layout
		- Need to store:
			- switches
			- sensors
			- stops
			- distances between everything
			- state of everything
		- Need to parse model file to hardcode the data into our code
	
	* Keep track of the train
		- THIS MUST BE EXTENSIBLE TO MULTIPLE TRAINS
		- distance
		- speed
		- location
		- destination 
		- currently allocated track
	
	* Prediction System (Detective - his name should be Watson)
		- Use the train data to predict where train will be
		- Plan routes (source -> dest)
		- Reserve tracks
		- Spawns workers to get work done

	* Documentation
