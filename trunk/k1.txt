Question 1
==========
    The executable is located in /u/becmacdonald/cs452/frogmuffins/main/main.elf.

    To operate the program type 'go'. Now, that wasn't so hard was it?
	There is no interactive input in this part of the assignnment, btw.
	Mostly because you lied to me Matt, but that's okay I forgive you. This time.

Question 2
==========
	The heart of the kernel is in the following loop:

	FOREVER {
		activeTask = schedule (activeTask, &priorityQueues);
		getNextRequest    	  (activeTask, &nextRequest);
		service 			  (activeTask, &nextRequest, &priorityQueues);
	}

	schedule() puts the active task on the ready queue for its priority. If the active task
	is blocked or called Exit(), then it is added to the blocked queue or not added to
	any queue, respectively. Then we grab the highest priority task from a ready queue and 
	set it as the active task. If there are no remaining tasks on any ready queue, a null
	active task is returned. We check this null task to determine when to stop running.

	The only issue with this scheduling algorithm is that there is possibility of starvation
	for the lower priority tasks. If a high priority task always has work to do and never calls
	Exit(), this task will always be scheduled and any lower priority tasks will never run. This
	is obviously unfair to low priority tasks, but this is the algorithm Professor Cowan gave 
	in class.

	getNextRequest() is a wrapper for the assembly function kernelExit() and they both take in 2
	parameters: the active task and a structure holding the request.
	The reason we have this wrapper is for debug statements. If this were production code,
	all debug statements would be optimized away using precompiler directives.

	Inside kernelExit(), the kernel state is saved first. Next, the active task's sp and spsr are
	copied from its task descriptor. The spsr is then installed. The return value is put into r0.
	We switch to system mode and restore the active task, carefully skipping r0.
	We switch back to supervisor mode so that we can install the pc of the active task, 
	while switching to the spsr.

	When the task performs a system request, swi with the appropriate immediate value is executed.
	This effectively calls kernelEntry(). KernelEntry() saves the active task's lr, clobbering the ip
	register, then switches to system mode, so that we can save active task's state. 
	We then switch back to supervisor mode and restore the kernel's registers holding 
	the address of active task's TD and Request. We put the sp, and spsr into the active task.
	We get the request type using VERY COOL bit masking arithmentic, behold:
		bic		r6,	r6, #0xFF000000 #; this line is MAGIC (I think the assembler is really smart)
	Then we fill the request with the arguments, restore the rest of kernel's registers and
	jump back to the kernel.
	Note: This returns to where kernelExit would return to if it was a normal function.

	Task descriptors are stored as structs and have the following members:
		int spsr;				// Saved Processor State Register
		int *sp;				// Stack Pointer
		int returnValue;		// Value to pass to asm if we need to 
								// return anything to a syscall
		int id;			 		// A unique identifying id
		int parentId;			// The unique id of the parent

		int priority;			// A priority value (ranges from 0->2)
							
		enum TASK_STATE state;	// State of the task - ACTIVE, READY, BLOCKED, DEFUNCT

		TD *nextPQ; 			// Link to the next TD in the PQ
		TD *prevPQ; 			// Link to the prev TD in the PQ
	
	Our priority code is managed by a struct named PQ. It has the following members:
		TD tdArray[64];			// Array of TDs until we have dynamic memory management

		int backPtr;			// Points to the next unused TD in the array
				
		Queue ready[NUM_PRIORITY]; 	// The ready queue
		int highestPriority;		// The highest non-empty bucket in the ready Q

		int nextId;				// The next unique task id
		Queue blocked;			// A single queue of blocked tasks
	
	Queue is simply a typedef'ed TD *.
	
	The ready queue has 1 bucket for each task priority. We currently have 3 unique priorities, but our
	code is flexible enough to recognize more. Each bucket contains a circular queue of task descriptors.
	The queues are circular so that we only need to store a pointer to the head of the list and can quickly 
	follow its back pointer to reach the tail. This allows for fast insertion onto the tail of each ready queue.
	When a queue only has 1 entry, the next and previous pointers are initialized to itself.

	Since we are not blocking any tasks during kernel 1, the blocked queue is a singly linked list of tasks.
	It will probably change for future assignments. 

	The highest priority pointer keeps track of the highest priority of all tasks in the ready queue. When
	it is time to schedule a new active task, we simply look at the head of the queue at this highest priority
	and return it. It means we have to do more management of this pointer, but we can schedule the highest 
	priority task in O(1) time. 

Question 3
==========
	The source code for our kernel is in: /u/becmacdonald/cs452/frogmuffins.
	

Question 4
==========

	.:
	arch  include  k1.txt  lib  main  Makefile  src

	./arch:
	switch.c  switch.S

	./include:
	assert.h  bwio.h  main.h  requests.h  shell.h  switch.h  td.h  ts7200.h

	./lib:
	libbwio.a

	./main:
	assert.c  main.c  orex.ld  requests.c  shell.c  td.c  main.elf

	./src:
	bwio.c  libbwio_old.q  Makefile


	NOTE: We are using Subversion as our version system.
		  There will be .svn folders in each folder.

	NOTE: k1.txt is the electronic version of this file.

Question 5
==========
	Here is our program's output:

	Initializing serial port connection.
	Initializing interrupt handler.
	Created 1.
	Created 2.
	Tid: 3 Parent Tid: 0.
	Tid: 3 Parent Tid: 0.
	Created 3.
	Tid: 4 Parent Tid: 0.
	Tid: 4 Parent Tid: 0.
	Created 4.
	First: exiting.
	Tid: 1 Parent Tid: 0.
	Tid: 2 Parent Tid: 0.
	Tid: 1 Parent Tid: 0.
	Tid: 2 Parent Tid: 0.
	Exiting normally.

	The first task creates tasks 1 and 2 at a lower priority. Thus, the first task continues to run and
	we don't schedule the 2 newest tasks. Then the first task creates task 3 with priority 0. This new task is
	of the highest priority so it runs to completion (ie. we do not schedule a lower priority task until this
	is done). Hence, the 3rd task outputs its data and exits.

	At this time, the first task has the highest priority again and creates task 4 with priority 0. Similarly to
	task 3, task 4 is of highest priority until it is done and, so, runs to completion without being interrupted.

	After task 4 exits, the first task is scheduled to run again. It prints "First: exiting." and exits. 

	Then the 2 lowest priority tasks, 1 and 2, are allowed to run. Since task 1 was created first and placed
	into the ready queue for priority 2 first, it runs first. After printing its data and calling Pass(),
	task 1 is placed onto the end of the ready queue. When schedule selects the next active task, task 2 is at
	the head of the queue and runs. It prints its data, calls Pass(), and is placed on the back of the ready queue.
	Task 1 is scheduled to run, prints its data for the final time and calls Exit(). At this point, it is
	not added as the tail of a priority queue and will not be scheduled to run again. 

	The final task on any priority queue is selected to run. Task 2 prints its data and calls exit. At this point,
	there are no more tasks in any ready queue so the program exits.

	Due to the order that the first task creates tasks and the priorities of each task, this output is in the 
	correct order.
