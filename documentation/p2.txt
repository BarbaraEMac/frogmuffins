	The following is a description of our train application.
	
	Model
	=====
	For this assignment, we simply use the reserved flag in each node to set it
	as reserved or not. Otherwise, oour abstraction of the track is identical 
	to the one for P1.

	Route Planner
	=============
	The Route Planner for P2 has a more robust reservation system. Other than
	that, it has remained mostly the same. We've made some minor modifications
	to our shortest distance calculator (Floyd-Warshall) to consider the extra
	distance required for a reverse in the middle of a path. This change may
	or may not be included in this version of our project.
	
		Sensor Predictions
		==================
		Since our sensor predictions worked for P1, we have not modified them for P2.
		We've simply added some Node Predictions.
	
		Node Predictions
		================
		In addition to determining all of the next sensors we could possibly hit,
		we now build a list of node predictions. This list includes every node
		a train will pass until it reaches a sensor. These predictions include
		each node a train could pass, independent of switch state or train direction.

		Reservations
		============
		When a train first asks for a new route, we cancel all of its previous 
		reservations and recompute the distance tables. This distance recompute will 
		observe the reservations made by any other trains during their new route calls.
		Cancelling the reservations at the beginning of the plan route call ensures
		that a train's shortest path route does not interfere with any of its 
		previous reservations.

		Once a train asks for a new path and gives the Route Planner the last 
		triggered sensor, the list of predicted nodes that the train could potentially
		trigger is created. Then, we reserve all of those nodes. If a train is 
		facing backwards along the desired path, all of the nodes behind the 
		train will also be reserved in case it does not reverse properly. 

		We also make sure to reserve the last triggered sensor so that a train
		sitting idle between 2 sensors will never allow another train to travel
		through it.

		If a node is reserved, the cost of the path to that node is INT_MAX. Hence,
		the shortest path from any node to any other will never include this node. 
		This is how we ensure that no two trains will have them crossing the same
		nodes at the same time. After a reservation is made, we recompute the 
		shortest distances, observing these reservations.

		The nodes stay reserved until the train hits another sensor and asks the 
		Route Planner to change the path. At this point, the previous reservation
		is cancelled and the new one is made. Therefore, nodes are only reserved 
		for 1 time step (where we define 1 time step to be the time for a train
		to move from 1 sensor to the next).

		Note: After a train makes its reservations, we do not call Floyd-Warshall
		to determine the new shortest paths. We do this because the next train to
		ask for a route will call Floyd-Warshall when it cancels its reservations.

		Reservation Struct
		==================
		The following is the data structure for the reservations:

		typedef struct {
			int len;		// Number of reserved nodes
			int idxs[8];	// Indicies of the reserved nodes
		} Reservation;

		There is 1 reservation stored for each train within the Route Planner.
		We index this reservation by the train id. At this point, our reservations
		have at most 8 nodes. We hope to reduce this number in the future to make 
		it more aggressive.

		No Path for a Train & Deadlocks
		===============================
		If another train's reservations have fully blocked in a train, the Route
		Planner replies with NO_PATH and a stopping distance of 0.

		In this case, the trapped train will stop moving and wake up a Route 
		Watcher task. This task will mimic a position / sensor update. The task 
		delays for a few seconds and then tells the train that it is at 
		a "new position". 

		Whenever a train has a new position, it asks for a new route. If the trapping
		train has moved, then the trapped train will have a valid path and can move 
		along it. If the trapping train has not moved far enough, the Route Watcher
		is woken up and this cycle continues.

		When we say "new position", the Route Watcher passes back the current
		stopped location and a new time stamp. Therefore, it is not actually a
		new location, but this call will trigger a plan route call with valid input.

		So long as two trains are always moving, our system will not result in a 
		deadlock since a train will always eventually move out of the way. 

		We can have a deadlock if a train 1 needs to go to destination B and 
		train 2 is sitting at B and not moving. We do not currently have
		the intelligence to reverse train 1 out of the way, let train 2 move off B, and
		then let train 1 stop on B. Depending on our project, we hope to have this
		working.

		Unfortunately, we do not currently have a systematic way to determine if a
		deadlock has occurred systematically. When testing, we are able to notice 
		this situation ourselves and assign new destinations for the trains to have 
		them move out of each other's way.

		Floyd-Warshall
		==============
		At a quick glance of our code, you will notice that we have implemented
		Dijkstra's Algorithm to determine the shortest path between 2 nodes.

		When reservations are cancelled and we want to recompute the distances,
		we found that running Floyd-Warshall is fast enough for what we need.

		Also, this allows us to "cache" our results for free. A train can always
		make a call to the Route Planner to determine the distance to the 
		nearest sensor and we don't need to recompute anything. We simply use the
		results that we already have.

		Therefore, while we realize that Floyd-Warshall might be overkill and,
		theoretically, too slow, it has worked in all of our tests so far.

	Detective
	=========

	Track Server
	============
	We have not modified how our project sends commands to the train controller.
	Therefore, the Track Server has not changed since the first project.

	Train
	=====
	Since the first iteration of our train was not working as smoothly as we would
	have liked, we have scrapped most of it and started again. The majority of the
	time spent on this assignment was spent on recoding this task.

		Server
		======
		Since the train has so many helper tasks, we've turned it into a server
		to simplify the code. Any Send call made by the train is guaranteed to be
		non-blocking. 

		Helper Tasks
		============
		The train currently has 3 helper tasks: 1 Heart, 1 Calibrator, 1 Route Watcher
		These are all notifier tasks so their priorities' are all one higher than 
		that of the train.

			Heart
			=====
			The heart is a timer task that delays for a set period of time and Sends
			to the train. Upon the wake up, a train can update it's location on the 
			track in between sensors.

			Hence, we can estimate the train's location anywhere on the track within
			the train's standard deviation worth of error. 
			(See Standard Deviation below).

			Calibration
			===========
			The goal of calibration is to be able to track the train and correctly
			estimate its speed and distance within a small standard deviation of
			error.

TODO:
			Thus, we run the train around the large loop of the track 3 times and 
			gather data to make these estimations. While estimating, we calculate
			the standard deviation of the estimations.

			The calibrator task moves the train to D9 and then E11 so that we 
			force a direction for it to travel around the loop.

			From E11, the calibrator tells the train to travel around the loop
			without changing speed until we have run around 3 times. After this
			third time, the train stops once it hits E11. It will usually travel
			much farther before actually stopping.

			At the shell, this actual stopping distance is manually entered into the
			train so that we can calibrate the hardcoded stopping distances.

			After this, the calibration tasks Exits.

			Route Watcher
			============
			This task has already been briefly explained in the Route Planner above.
			It is only woken up when a train cannot create any vaild path. After
			Delaying for a set time, it Sends to the train to wake it up and try
			to plan a new route. If the blocking train has moved and made new
			reservations, then this train will be free to plan a route.

		Stopping Distances
		==================
		During calibration, a manual stopping distance for the calibration speed
		is stored in the train.

		When determining which speed to travel at, we consider the stopping distance.
		If we have a long way to go, the train can speed up. The closer a train gets
		to the desired distance, the slower it should travel. 

		We currently have some stopping distances hardcoded into the train task.
		As trains are dropped, used more, oiled, etc, their stopping distances 
		change. To get around this, we can slightly alter the hardcoded stopping
		distances given the measured one as follows:

			stopDist = Hardcoded distance for the current speed.

			stopDist *= Measured stop distance for default speed.
			stopDist /= Hardcoded stop distance for default speed.

		We do it in this manner since it will avoid floating point calculations.

		Position Update
		===============
		When the detective gets a sensor that a train predicted, it tells the 
		train in the form of a postion update. At that current point in time,
		the train knows exactly where it is and its direction.

		At this point we do the following:
			Reply to the detective.
			Ask for a new route given the new start location.
				If there is no path,
					Stop driving.
					Wake up the Route Watcher.
			If the train is facing backwards,
				Reverse.
			Adjust your speed given the new distance until stopping.
			If the distance until stopping is not 0,
				Flips the switches you need.
				Tell the Detective about the predicted nodes.
	
		Route Planning
		==============
		In order to keep the train task simple and focussed on driving at the correct
		speed, the train does not know anything about the landmarks on the track.

		When the Route Planner returns, it simply gives the train a distance
		until it needs to stop. While this is more complicated to handle within
		the train, it makes the navigation code simple.

		Prediction
		==========
		When the Route Planner returns, a list of all nodes the train could possibly
		hit is returned. These predictions are forwarded on to the Detective with
		an estimated time window for hitting them.

		Reservations
		============
		The track is automatically reserved within the call to plan route. This 
		ensures that the train stays as simple as possible and can just focus on 
		driving and calibrating.


		
	
	UI / Shell
	==========
	Not much has changed with these two user tasks since they were mostly working
	for our Project 1 demo. The following is a list of the changes.

		UI
		==
		Since we are now tracking 2 trains, we will display the location of each
		train separately on the map.

		Shell
		=====
		During train calibration, the shell will now be blocked until a train is 
		fully calibrated.

	Error Codes
	===========
	We created the following error codes for the project:
		TIMEOUT,				// A timeout has occurred
		DET_INVALID_REQ_TYPE,	// Invalid Track Detective request type
		INVALID_NODE_NAME,		// Invalid node name
		INVALID_NODE_IDX,		// Invalid node index
		RP_INVALID_REQ_TYPE,	// Invalid request type for the Route Planner
		INVALID_SENSOR_IDX,		// Invalid sensor index
		INVALID_TRAIN_SPEED,	// Invalid train speed (avg speed)
		INVALID_TRACK			// Invalid track identifier
		NO_PATH					// There is no path for the train
	
	Whenever a server request is made, we always check for these error values
	in the reply. If there is an error, the user task should attempt to handle
	it.

	Neat Things
	===========
	We did some neat things for this assignment. Here's a brief discussion of
	some of them.

		Kernel
		======
		Since we started working on the project, we have not modified our kernel.
